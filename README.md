## Supermart Grocery Sales-Retail Analysis

The purpose of this SUPERMART GROCERY SALES-RETAIL ANALYSIS Capstone Project for the Boston Institute of Analytics is to provide insights into the sales and customer behavior of Supermart, a fictional grocery store. By analyzing the store's sales data, we aim to identify patterns and trends in customer purchasing behavior, determine which products are most popular among customers. This analysis will help Supermart optimize their inventory management, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase profitability.
